    <p>SMF is a freelancing organization, we're fairly new to the competition but we're looking to make a<br />
    name for ourselves in the market of web development. They way we like to do things is fairly simple, we<br />
    work on a project to project basis until we can get more freelancers working for us. We accept any projects<br />
    you have to offer us and our pricing reflects that. Most of the time, the pricing depends on the type of<br />
    work we're going to be doing because some languages require more time to work on than others (looking at you JS).<br />
    But we always get our projects finished within a reasonable amount of time. If you are looking for someone with<br />
    experience on MySQL, we have Vulcan, who is in the process of learning it and if you're looking for JavaScript, we<br />
    have ShockEMP and Macky who are both partially experienced in the field. Currently, our strongest languages are HTML5,<br />
    CSS3, and JavaScript with some Python and Ruby mixed in. Currently, we don't have anyone learning Perl but that may soon<br />
    change if demand increases. Our goal is currently to provide our clients with the necessary elements to manage a website<br />
    while we also offer web management. The webmaster is Macky, who has the experience required to maintain your website<br />
    if the need is there. Web management can be requested through our Contact forms on the next page if that's what you're<br />
    looking for. Thank you for visiting the official SMF website and we hope you consider us for your next website.</p>
